  Sing, my tongue, the glo -- rious bat -- tle,
  Sing the end -- ing of the fray;
  Now a -- bove the Cross, the tro --  phy,

  Tell how Christ, the world's Re -- deem -- er,
  As a Vic -- tim won the day.

  God in pit -- y saw man fal -- len,
  Shamed and sunk in mis -- er -- y,
  When he fell on death by tast -- ing
  Fruit of the for -- bid -- den tree;
  Tha an -- oth -- er tree was cho -- sen
  Which the world from death should free.

  Thus the scheme of our sal -- va -- tion
  Was of old in or -- der laid,
  That the man -- i -- fold de -- ceiv -- er's
  Art by art might be out -- weighed,
  And the lure the foe put for -- ward
  In -- to means of heal -- ing made.

  There -- fore when the_ap -- point -- ed full -- ness
  Of the ho -- ly time was come,
  He was sent who mak -- eth all things
  Forth from God's e -- ter -- nal home;
  Thus he came to earth, in -- car -- nate,
  Off -- spring of a mai -- den's womb.

  Thir -- ty years a -- mong us dwel -- ling,
  His ap -- point -- ed time ful -- filled,
  Born for this, He meets His Pas -- sion,
  For that this He free -- ly willed,
  On the Cross the Lamb is lift -- ed
  Where his life -- blood shall be spilled.
